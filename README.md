# Intro 

**Autonomous agents** possess reasoning and planning capabilities similar to human intelligence, making them advanced AI systems. They are essentially LLMs with brain that has the ability to self-reason and plan the decomposition of the tasks.


# Observations 

CrewAI is very powerful for orchestrating agents in sequence but does not yet have the "routing" capability, meaning it cannot redirect the flow to different agents based on user input.

It is suitable for performing complex specific tasks.

# Key Takeaways

1. CrewAI provides wide range of multi-agent functionality and workflows, that helps in efficient task decomposition.

2. Agents Prompt Engineering stands out as a crucial factor for enhancing task decomposition and planning.
